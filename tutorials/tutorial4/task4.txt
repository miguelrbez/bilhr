Comparison of MLP and CMAC

general comparison
- implementation of CMAC was simpler than MLP

training phase
- CMAC needs a lot more training samples
	-> if the number of samples is decreased, the MSE is too high and the arm movements are not natural



execution phase
- the output of CMAC can be grater than one -> problem with denormalization
- CMAC has general problems in the edges of the input
	-> in the center of the image the movement is ok
	-> but in the edges the output is far away from the expectation
- CMAC is not as smooth as MLP
